## Introduction

<blockquote>

### What is Rockr?
Rockr is a web application that connects the user to available chairs in their area in a swipe-left swipe-right Tinder fashion. 

### Features and Benefits
Rockr allows users to create accounts and either create listings for their own chairs, or look for other peoples listings.
When a listing is "matched" with a user, the listing owner can connect to the matched user through a chat to secure a deal.

### Target Audience
Anyone looking to waste as little time and effort as possible in their search for chairs.
